Flight Delays and Cancellations Analysis in Power BI
#
I am passionate and data-driven analyst with a strong track record of turning insights into successful ventures. Having built a thriving yogurt manufacturing business, I now have the financial strength and curiosity to explore new investment opportunities. One industry that has captured my attention is aviation — a sector where operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and timely performance can make or break profitability.
Before committing my resources to this highly competitive market, I have decided to conduct a deep, data-backed market analysis. Using a large-scale Flights Dataset containing over 5 000 000 flight records across multiple airlines, airports, and time periods, I aim to reveal which airlines perform best, which ones struggle, and the key drivers behind success or failure.
#
My analysis dives into flight delays, cancellations, on-time performance, and the underlying causes. By combining advanced analytics, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations in Power BI, I will identify:</br>
--Underperforming carriers and the factors contributing to their challenges.</br>
--Market patterns and opportunities that can guide a strategic investment decision.

This project not only highlights the winners and losers in the airline industry, but also provides a clear, data-driven roadmap for potential investors — like myself — to make smart, profitable moves in the aviation market.
